# VLSI solving using SMT
SMT is just a draft.

## Execution
`exec_all_no_rotations.py` feeds instances to the models. Make sure that `DEFAULT_INSTANCES_DIR` constant is properly set to find json instances files (if no files have been touched, it is correctly configured):
```bash
python exec_all_no_rotation.py
````
